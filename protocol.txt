On new connection:

	client connects directly to seed (ip or web address)

	if new user:
		client sends desired username and password
		seed stores
	if old user:
		sends seed username, password
		seed verifies

	seed asks for patrons of the user:
		sends all the username
		users either ignore, or reply "accept <user>"
		wait until two/three/whatever replies

	seed tells joining user and patrons of connection details
	seed sends new user timestamped username and web-wide key

	user generates public/private keys and connects to patrons
	user sends random 32-bit number to both patrons, timestamped name and public key
		(also stores for self)

		patrons send to all their connected friends a newuser message:
			number+1 mod 2^31, timestamped name, public key

		friends decrypt and check the timestamp (within 5 mins)
		friends store name, direction recieved from and 'distance'
			swap and send on if a smaller distance is found
				if (new_distance - current_distace) % 2^31 < 0
			pick randomly if equal distances

		REPEAT

	patrons send new user their 'address directory'
		user compiles shortest routes from the two

	user is now a node of the web



On message send:
	
	construct an onion by randomly choosing a path (including self at some point):
		message = [ target, padding & salting, message = [ ... ] ]

	send along shortest route

	each node will then:
		receive
		send along shortest route
	or (if they are the intended target):
		recieve
		decrypt
		either send along OR display
